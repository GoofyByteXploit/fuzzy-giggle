# fuzzy-giggle

An assortment of random thoughts, odd experiments, and the occasional half-baked idea.  

## What’s inside

- Bits of code that may or may not compile  
- Sentences that started as notes and ended as riddles to myself  
- A sprinkle of chaos for good measure  

## Why “fuzzy-giggle”?

Because sometimes a name just sounds right.  
No deep meaning, no grand mission—just a place to toss things that don’t fit anywhere else.

Enjoy the randomness, or don’t. It will giggle either way.
